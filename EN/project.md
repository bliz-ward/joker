Intercultural communication relies heavily on translation. Both presuppose the development of different strategies to overcome the obstacles that can block or hinder intercultural dialogues. Humor remains by far one of the most difficult aspects of intercultural communication, as it relies heavily on cultural references and a subtle exploitation of the creativity, syntactic and lexicographic features of each language. 

Puns are a common source of humor in jokes and comedy shows. Puns have been used by novelists, poets and playwrights. Humor studies are now crucial when it comes to social listening, dialogue and recommendation systems, reputation monitoring, fake news and hate speech detection, etc. Puns are often used for their attention-grabbing or mnemonic value in titles, place names, organizations, advertising, etc. The translation of humor and puns is therefore in high demand. However, understanding humor often requires capturing implicit cultural references and/or double meanings, which of course raises the question of the (in)translatability of humor. For these reasons, humor translation strategies are largely studied from a linguistic perspective. 

Modern translation is heavily assisted by technological tools; yet, few works have studied the automation of humor and puns translation as well as the creation of humor corpora. Current machine translation engines fail to localize humor. There are few monolingual humor corpora; for example, Semantic Evaluation SemEval: **#HashtagWars: Learning a Sense of Humor**, **Detection and Interpretation of English Puns**, **Assessing Humor in Edited News Headlines**, **HaHackathon: Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense**. Other monolingual corpora are constructed from news headlines, proverbs, British National Corpus, Yahoo!Answers etc. Most of the datasets are in English; a few exceptions are in Italian, Russian and Spanish.

The aim of this evaluation campaign is two-fold:
* interaction with undergraduate students (leader: Sílvia Araújo) 
* providing benchmarks for humour and pun machine translation (leader: Liana Ermakova)

The first year, JOKER will be a workshop with two pilot tasks:
* humour classification 
* pun translation
